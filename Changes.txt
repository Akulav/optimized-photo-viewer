Made CacheOperator more modular
Removed redundant assign in DataProber
Removed redundant assign in ImageDeleter
Made ImageLoader more modular
ImageRotater now uses BMP (still no compression applied, but possibly faster than png)
Made AddImagesToGrid more modular
Removed CacheOperator.RemoveEntry on Image Deletion (it is done in background anyway every 200ms)

Any change is saved the moment the button is pressed in the settings window
